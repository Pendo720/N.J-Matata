## Introduction

This page is a minimal portfolio showcasing a selected number projects carried out by the author in his free-time. 
Following projects were selected to illustrate the author's capabilities in the use of the respective programming 
languages and techniques.

This page is a work in progress and will be continuously updated to reflect authors activities. 

### Project 1: Track-Sys (Java/Kotlin/Typescript)  
#### _Overview_
Track-Sys is a complete system for tracking events. These can be anything where human activity is involve and 
some traceability is required for managerial operations. 
The project consists of the following components: 
 - [a microservice for managing the associate data streams in the activity](https://github.com/Pendo720/TrackerMS)
 - [a web portal showing registered events in real-time](https://github.com/Pendo720/Track-Sys-Dashboard) 
 - [a mobile app for capturing event data](https://github.com/Pendo720/M-Front)
  
The following screenshots show the front-ends during operation

> **Todo:**
>   - describe the operation using the screenshots
>   - fix paginator on the web fontend  
 
### [Project 2: Neural Network Classifier (Java)](https://github.com/Pendo720/nn-fp)  
#### _Overview_
This is a customisable neural network created to consolidate understanding of neural networks. The code implements
an easily customisable network. The architectural customisation entails configuration of both layers and the neurons 
in each of the layer. This flexibility enables use of the network in diverse problem scenarios.
> **Todo:**
>  - breakdown the project
>  - plan a solution 
>  - implement it

### [Project 3: Single-Value-SQM (Python)](https://github.com/Pendo720/svsqm)  
#### _Overview_
A common problem encountered when assessing the quality of software artifact is the absence of a standard
upon which comparisions of a given artifact can be assessed. The Single-value software quality metric is
practical framework for facilitating such comparisions. This project is an extension of my master's 
programme: software quality module.

In addition to providing a single-value metric for software quality, the visual above can help identify 
the aspect of the artifact qualities which need addressing to better its quality. The artifact quality 
measure is the average of the individual values on the four dimensions: Specification, Documentation, Implementation and Testing

Note: the quantities on both the Testing and Documentation dimensions are negated for visualisation purposes.
> **Todo:**
> - explain the benefit and possible application of such framework 
> - include any references 

### [Project 4: k-Means Clustering (C++)](https://github.com/Pendo720/kmeans-fp)  
#### _Overview_
AI and ML in particular is finding use in different aspect of our daily life. As one of the pivotal 
components of AI, the ability to aggregate data on the basis of a given trait of the data(feature) has 
proven to be an effective means for acquiring insights into the data. k-Means algorithm is one of the 
unsupervised ML algorithms for grouping(clustering) data by means of some intrinsic traits in the data. 
> **Todo:**
> - describe application(line-based robot) automation
> - implement it
> - document it all
