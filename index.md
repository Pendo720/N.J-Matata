## Profile

This page is a minimalist portfolio showcasing some of the projects carried out during periods 
I was unemployed. The following projects were selected for their illustration of the my capabilities in the
use of the respective programming languages and techniques.

### [Project 1: Single-value software quality metric - Python](https://github.com/Pendo720/svsqm)  
#### Overview
A common problem encountered when assessing the quality of software artifact is the absence of a standard
upon which comparisions of a given software artifacts can be assessed. The Single-value software quality metric is
an attempt to build a framework to enable such comparisions. This project is an extension of my master's 
programme: software quality module.
