## Introduction

This page is a minimal portfolio showcasing a selected number projects carried out during periods of my 
unemployed. The following projects were selected for their illustration of my capabilities in the
use of the respective programming languages and techniques.

### [Project 1: Single-value software quality metric - Python](https://github.com/Pendo720/svsqm)  
#### Overview
A common problem encountered when assessing the quality of software artifact is the absence of a standard
upon which comparisions of a given artifact can be assessed. The Single-value software quality metric is
practical framework for facilitating such comparisions. This project is an extension of my master's 
programme: software quality module.

### [Project 2: k-Means Clustering - C++](https://github.com/Pendo720/kmeans-fp)  
#### Overview
AI and ML in particular is finding use in different aspect of our daily life. As one of the pivotal 
components of AI, the ability to aggregate data on the basis of a given trait of the data(feature) has 
proven to be an effective means for acquiring insights into the data. k-Means algorithm is one of the 
unsupervised ML algorithms for grouping(clustering) data by means of some intrinsic traits in the data. 

### [Project 3: Customisable Neural Network - Java](https://github.com/Pendo720/nn-fp)  
#### Overview

### [Project 4: RT-Event Router - Java/Angular](https://github.com/Pendo720/Tri-Font)  
#### Overview

### [Project 5: Event Generator - Android/Kotlin](https://github.com/Pendo720/nfc-eg)  
#### Overview
